This was a test using the micropython framework. All the main code is in main.py and notes.py stores the relation between frequencies and notes.
This application sends a PWM Signal trough a speaker which plays the Mario theme song. 
This signal is also picked up by our ADC which sends it via UART1 to itself because the UART is shorted.
There are three threads:
-> One for playing the song
-> One for reading the UART
-> One for capturing the PWM signal using the ADC and sending the values via UART
After this routine the esp enters deepsleep for 10 seconds before starting again.
