Writes 256 bytes of random data capped at 255 on our EEPROM using SPI.
Applies those random bytes as a voltage through the DAC. 0 = 0v | 255 = 3.3V
After this the ESP32 enters deepsleep mode and can be woken up using a touch sensor to start the application once again. 

Known "issues": when the ESP32 is in deepsleep it not always registers the touch sensor being pressed. if tested, it is recommended to hold the touch sensor until it registers and the ESP restarts.
