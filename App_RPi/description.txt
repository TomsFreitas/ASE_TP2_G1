Using several types of environmental sensors (Temperature, humidity, noise activity and light) and a raspberry pi
it is possible to build a simple environmental logging station.

This project reads sensor data, exposes said data over a REST API and it is then scrapped and stored using Prometheus.

Combined with grafana it is possible to display this data, in a timeseries format, to the end user.

This system is combined with the flexibility and ease of use of docker containers.
